That space was set up to test another way of making an editorial process public and to open that process to the collaboration of a larger group of people, perhaps unexpected, in different spaces and times.
<br><br><br>

Here are spreads from the 2012 publication<br>
‘Fernand Baudin Students Publications - A proposal’<br>
open to comments, corrections, additions, etc. until the 20th of February!<br>
