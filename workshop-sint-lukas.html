<br><br>Dear Sint-Lukas students,<br><br>
You will find here some information about a workshop called “Play the Art Book Scene”.<br>
This workshop proposes an intensive approach on making books, focusing on the interaction of content and form, on the relation between different actors/steps in the process of making a book, encouraging critical reflection, quality productions and rich collaborations between the participants - students from different disciplines: fine arts, photography, graphic design, illustration, etc. <br>
You will then engage in a book project, in collaboration with a group of other actors/students.
<br>This workshop aims to provide you with a greater consciousness of the art publishing scene, through acting that scene, taking a position, playing a role in it. Perhaps reinventing it.
<br><br>Looking forward,
<br><br>Loraine<br><br>for<br>F B S P<br>
