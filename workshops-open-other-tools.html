Tools to make books - tools to reflect upon books. <br>
This workshop focus on free/open source tools to make books, and on everything this approach implies and allows in terms of publication and its mediation. The approach of free culture promises rich interactions between the user and its tools, between the user and a community of other users (challenging the usual “producer”/“public” distinction and roles...); the creation of dynamics of sharing (“publication” not only of the works but also the process, making things public, shared) and collaborations, with the possible coexistence of different expertises…<br><br>

Workshop in two parts: <span style="color:#FFF000">14.00</span> - collective making of a booklet documenting last workshop at Théophile’s Papers, testing a range of open source/alternative tools (see for instance Roland-the-plotter in the OSP picture down there). The booklet is the first of a series documenting each F&nbsp;B&nbsp;S&nbsp;P workshop. <span style="color:#FFF000">19.00</span> - dinner and presentations of editorial/graphic projects questioning and shaping their tools. <br>Presentations by Colm O’Neill (preview of a movie in progress on his experience as an intern/collaborator at OSP) and Romain Marula (thesis and diploma project: graphic design/art works).<br>Discussions on the basis of the working session of the afternoon and the presentations: what kind of tools exist, what tools would we need, what can we imagine and propose?
