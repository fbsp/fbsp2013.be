  <p style="margin-left:2%; margin-right:3%">In order to test several modes of collective critical thinking, Fernand Baudin Students Publications organises a series of situated workshops, happening in parallel to the official academical context - open to students from all schools, disciplines and academical years, and to a wider audience via email inscriptions.<br>
Sometimes hosted in the schools' buildings, sometimes happening in other spaces, the workshops will turn around the notion of tools for editorial practices, approaching it from different axes, in relation to its guest place's own problematics. The collaborative working groups will progressively build a toolbox for the event, filled with questions, ideas, propositions, fictions... all kinds of tools needed to prepare and feed F B S P 2013.</p>
