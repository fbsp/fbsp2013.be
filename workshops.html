<span style="color:#FFF000">OPEN/OTHER TOOLS</span><br>
Tuesday 5th of March<br>
At <a href="http://variable.constantvzw.org/">Variable</a> - rue Gallait straat 80, Bxl<br>
Tools to make books - tools to reflect upon books. <br>
The workshop will happen in two parts: <span style="color:#FFF000">14.00</span> - collective making of a booklet documenting last workshop at Théophile’s Papers, testing a range of open source/alternative tools (see for instance Roland-the-plotter in the OSP picture down there). The booklet will be the first of a series documenting each F B S P workshop. <span style="color:#FFF000">19.00</span> - dinner and presentations of editorial/graphic projects questioning and shaping their own tools. Discussions on the basis of the working session of the afternoon and the presentations: what kind of tools exist, what tools would we need, what can we imagine and propose?
<br>
<br>
<img src='/WS-tools1.png' class="center2"><br>
The workshop will focus on free/open source tools to make books, and on everything this approach implies and allows in terms of publication and its mediation. The approach of free culture promises rich interactions between the user and its tools, between the user and a community of other users (challenging the usual “producer”/“public” distinction and roles...); the creation of dynamics of sharing (“publication” not only of the works but also the process, making things public, shared) and collaborations, with the possible coexistence of different expertises…<br><br>
Multilingual workshop! <br>No necessary prior experience with any particular tool, we’ll help each other with our different expertises.
<br>Free: inscription by <a href="mailto:info@fbsp2013.be">email</a> for the afternoon or the evening, or both.

F B S P<a id="workshop"> </a>toolbox workshops:<br><br>
In order to test several modes of collective critical thinking, <a href="http://fbsp2013.be/">Fernand Baudin Students Publications</a> organises a series of situated workshops, happening in parallel to the official academical context - open to students from all schools, disciplines and academical years, and to a wider audience via email inscriptions.<br>
Sometimes hosted in the schools’ buildings, sometimes happening in other spaces, the workshops will turn around the notion of tools for editorial practices, approaching it from different axes, in relation to its guest place’s own problematics. The collaborative working groups will progressively build a toolbox to make and reflect upon books, filled with questions, ideas, propositions, fictions...

Workshop <a href="mailto:info@fbsp2013.be">propositions</a> welcome.
