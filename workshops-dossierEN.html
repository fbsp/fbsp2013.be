In a context of full bloom of art publishing and digital (publishing and writing) developments, the editorial activity and its ecosystem are at a crucial turning point in their evolution. This situation calls for creativity and impulsions in the questioning and the development of contemporary editorial practices - to which Fernand Baudin Students Publications tries to react with a series of workshops, amongst other events.<br>
Addressing this project to the students context, we propose to make it active and put it in relation with other actors - thus creating a new dynamic network.

Since 2012, <a href="/">Fernand Baudin Students Publications</a> organises a series of workshops dedicated to contemporary forms of publishing, from paper to digital formats, approaching editorial practices along different axes, in relation to their guest place’s own problematics and the participants’ work. Each workshop experience will progressively enrich a common platform with propositions, questions, ideas, fictions...
<br><br>
This year we are proposing four different workshop lines, “à la carte”, to be adapted to each workshop context: experiences of acting the art book scene, working on reference texts, re-appropriating the tools for production and tools for thinking and working in a situated way with local actors and events.
<br><br>

The objective of these workshops is to involve actors of the academic field (students, teachers, as well as librarians for instance) in a larger project, aiming to stimulate the creation of a larger and active network of research: setting research contexts (itinerary and occasional), supporting diversity in the approaches, connecting actors, giving visibility to the projects.


<div class="print-only">
<br><br><br><br><br><br>
* <span style="color: #FFF000">Fernand Baudin Students Publications</span> is a research project on contemporary art publishing, involving different actors - and amongst them students, emerging actors - to create an active network of reflection on these practices.<br>
This project, initiated in 2012 by members of Prix Fernand Baudin (www.prixfernandbaudinprijs.be/), proposes different ways of making research around editorial practices. It aims to offer a common space for knowledge and productions to enrich the publishing scene and its evolution. Alternative to classic academic research practices, this platform brings together researchers from various horizons and cultures, in a point de convergence between different forms of knowledge, theoretical and sensible approaches. A multidimensional tool in progress.<br>
Since 2012, F B S P organises events (lectures, exhibitions, collective editing sessions, participation to fairs) and a series of workshops, relayed and diffused on a dedicated web platform.

<div style="text-align: center; color: #FFF000">PROPOSITIONS DE WORKSHOPS</div><br>
Public: Students from different domains, bringing various types of knowledge and competencies, different approaches - to stimulate meetings and collaborations.<br><br>

PLAY THE ART BOOK SCENE<br><br>
This workshop program proposes its participants to form groups made of different actors from the publishing field (editor, author, graphic designer, photographer, printer, distributor, etc) to “act” a publishing process, taking into account the whole ecosystem of the publishing field.<br>
Each group thus proposes a type of publishing structure (from small-scale, self-publishing, to bigger traditional formats) linked to a particular type of editorial production: catalogue, artist book, digital book, novel, fanzine…<br><br>

Production: Editorial project, possibility to organise a final event (exhibition, fair…)<br>
Number of participants: 15-20.<br>
Length: 3-5 days.
<br><br><br>

THERE IS NO DEATH OF THE BOOK, ONLY WAYS OF READING<br>
(Gilles Deleuze, Félix Guattari, Rhizomes, 1976)<br><br>
This workshop is named after a citation from Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari (Rhizomes,1976). It proposes its participants to start from one or several extracts of reference texts in the history of the art book, to develop a project and a (contemporary) position in relation to it.
Examples of texts: Ulises Carriòn, “On Books”, Christoph Keller, “re: a place where things cannot come to their end” (in Books Make Friends), Liner notes – Conversations About Making Books, i.e. Leipzig, Alessandro Ludovico, Post-digital print: the mutation of publishing since 1894, Dieter Roelstraete, “Art Books Now – Seven Theses (From the Accomplice’s Point of View)”, Matthew Stadler, “The Social Space of Reading”…
<br><br>
Production: book, performance, video/photography...<br>
Number of participants : ± 10.<br>
Length: 4-5 days.<br>

TOOLS FOR PUBLISHING<br><br>
Production tools as well as tools for thinking. This workshop program interrogates the tools we use to work on publications, and those that are being developed, those that we don’t use yet, those that don’t exist yet… Tools for writing, for working together, tools for form-giving, as well as diffusion and distribution tools.<br>
It will also be an occasion to move the “traditional” uses of some tools to work on other kinds of productions (for instance using HTML code to prepare a print document).
<br><br>
Production: Projet éditorial individuel ou collectif.<br>
Number of participants: 10-15.<br>
Length: 4-5 days.
<br><br><br>

SITUATED WORKSHOPS<br><br>
This workshop program proposes to its participants to work in a situated way (see Donna Harraway’s Situated Knowledges), in a local temporary of permanent structure (fair, event, conference, bookshop, library, gallery). It implies interacting with actors of these structures, starting discussions, observing, and then proposing a piece (article, essay, photographic report, poster…) on that meeting. The pieces will be publishing on a platform, growing along the different workshops, creating an active and expending network of knowledge and relations.
<br><br>
Production: Piece of research, in a wide sense (from the visual object to the essay, interview, cartography, atlas, inventory, scheme, list, fiction…).<br>
Number of participants: 10-15.<br>
Length: 3-5 days.
