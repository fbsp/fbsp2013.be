<p style="color: #FFF000">PLAY THE ART BOOK SCENE</p>
This workshop proposes its participants to form groups made of different actors from the publishing field (editor, author, graphic designer, photographer, printer, distributor, etc) to “act” a publishing process, taking into account the whole ecosystem of the publishing field.<br>
Each group thus invests a type of publishing structure (from small-scale, self-publishing, to bigger traditional formats) linked to a particular type of editorial production: catalogue, artist book, digital book, novel, fanzine…<br><br>

<p style="text-transform: uppercase; color: #FFF000">"there is no death of the book, <br>only another way of reading"</p>
This workshop is named after a citation from Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari (Rhizomes,1976). It proposes its participants to start from one or several extract of reference texts in the history of the art book, to develop a project and a (contemporary) position in relation to it.

<p style="color: #FFF000">TOOLS FOR PUBLISHING</p>
Production tools as well as tools for thinking. This workshop program interrogates the tools we use to work on publications, and those that are being developed, those that we don’t use yet, those that don’t exist yet… Tools for writing, for working together, tools for form-giving, as well as diffusion and distribution tools.<br><br>

<p style="color: #FFF000">SITUATED WORKSHOPS</p>
This workshop program proposes to its participants to work in a situated way (see Donna Harraway’s Situated Knowledges), in a local temporary or permanent context (fair, event, conference, bookshop, library, gallery). It implies interacting with actors of these structures, starting discussions, abserving, and then proposing a piece (article, essay, photographic report, poster…) on that meeting. The pieces will be publishing on a platform, growing along the different workshops, creating an active and expending network of knowledge and relations.
