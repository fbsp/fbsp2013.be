<p style="margin-left:2%; margin-right:3%">Fernand Baudin Students Publications invites you to a unprecedented event at MAD Brussels where the upcoming and almost finished FBSP 2012 catalogue - The Event Issue will be exhibited on the walls, inviting your intervention, making the whole event become an editorial space / the publication itself becoming an event!
The public will be invited to participate to this experiment of editorial collaboration, annotating the pages, writing comments in the margins, etc.
<br>
The elements added during this event will then be integrated into the publication, which will be launched at the end of February!
<br><br>
Come have a drink, dance and edit with us at MAD Brussels on 11.01.13!
