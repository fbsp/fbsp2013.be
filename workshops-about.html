<p>
Since 2012, <a href="/">Fernand Baudin Students Publications</a> organises a series of workshops dedicated to contemporary forms of publishing, from paper to digital formats, approaching editorial practices from different axes, in relation to their guest place’s own problematics.
<br><br>
Lead by Loraine Furter and Esther Le Roy, each workshop experience will progressively enrich a common platform with propositions, questions, ideas, fictions...
<br><br>
We are proposing <a href="/workshops-propositions">four different workshop lines</a>, “à la carte”, with experiences of acting the art book scene, working on reference texts, re-appropriating the tools for production and tools for thinking and working in a situated way with local actors and events.
<br><br>
Each workshop starts with a presentation/conference on the topic and problematics developped in the proposition. <br><br>

A selection of books accompanies the different steps of the workshop, from the presentation to the worksessions — a reference library that is augmented by the participants and in partnership with the school’s library.<br><br>

For each workshop we create a web page and a corresponding workbook with references, ressources, links and tools to be used during the worksessions.

And some specific technical sessions related to the participants’ needs are set up.<br><br>
