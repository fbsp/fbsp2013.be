<p>
Since 2012, <a href="/">Fernand Baudin Students Publications</a> organises a series of workshops dedicated to contemporary forms of publishing, from paper to digital formats, approaching editorial practices from different axes, in relation to their guest place’s own problematics. Each workshop experience will progressively enrich a common platform with propositions, questions, ideas, fictions...
<br><br>
This year we are proposing <a href="/workshops-propositions">four different workshop lines</a>, “à la carte”, with experiences of acting the art book scene, working on reference texts, re-appropriating the tools for production and tools for thinking and working in a situated way with local actors and events.
<br><br>
Each workshop starts with a presentation/conference on the topic and problematics developped in the proposition. <br>
Each workshop is accompained with a selection of books — a reference library that is augmented by the participants and in partnership with the school’s library.<br><br>

And some specific technical sessions related to the participants needs are organised during the workshop.<br><br>
