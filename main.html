Fernand Baudin Students Publications is a new, yearly, independent, experimental, speculative - perhaps fictional - low budget, highly ambitious, critical and collective project. It is dedicated to forms of research on contemporary editorial practices. <br>Initiated by members of <a href="http://www.prixfernandbaudinprijs.be/">Prix Fernand Baudin Prijs</a>, it happens in connection with the belgian student′s context and the international publishing scene.
It aims to create a common space between students and professionals, research and practice, thinking and making, ... through conversation, collaboration, love.<br>
The three first editions of the event - 2012 to 2014 - are very important years, for they propose to think about the format of this new kind of event and to shape it collectively, instead of imposing (an existing) one.
<a href="http://studentspublications.tumblr.com/">Last year</a>, F B S P focussed on the notion of event. What kind of events exist around publishing practices and what can we imagine for this specific project? It presented an exhibition of publications made by students, a program of lectures and a collective debate. The 2012 catalogue was thought as an event in itself, another moment, another space – taking further the discussions, allowing people who couldn't come to participate through margin comments, etc. It is still in its (collective) editing process, and will be soon launched.<br>
This year is dedicated to the notion of <font color="#FFFF00;">tools</font>. Tools for thinking as well as production tools. In the various processes and steps of making and thinking publications, we use different kinds of tools, to conceptualise, edit, layout, fund, produce, print, bind, communicate and distribute editorial objects. No tool is obvious - a lot of contemporary editorial practices show a great interest (sometimes necessity) in shaping and inventing their own tools. No tool is neutral. <a href="#REF1">[1]</a> Tools shape practice, practice shapes tools, ∞ <a href="#REF1">[2]</a><br>
This will also imply questioning the event in itself as a tool, and its different formats (exhibition, lecture, debate, screening, dinner, evening, party...) as ways of producing shared knowledge and critical thinking.

<a id="REF1">1]</a> “What I call ecology of practice is a tool for thinking what is happening, and a tool is never neutral.Also, a tool can be passed from hand to hand, but each time the gesture of taking it in hand will be aparticular one: the tool is not a general mean, defined as adequate for a set of particular aims,potentially including the one of the person who is taking it, and it does not entail a judgement on thesituation as justifying its use.” Isabelle Stengers, <span style="border-bottom: 3px solid">Ecology of Practices and Technology of Belonging</span>, 2005<br><br>
